# Free Data Science Resources

Almost free online resources for learning Data Science. Previously, they have been lying in my bookmarks for quite some time, but now, I'll share them with a clear structure to be easy to learn. Note much of the content overlaps, make your choice by your taste.

It’s still under construction.
